Finally, the last iterator Iâ€™d like to focus on is the
LimitIterator. This iterator provides
functionality for returning limited results from an iterator. In its
simplest form, you can pass an iterator object to it (such as a
DirectoryIterator object, as Example 7
illustrates) and include an offset and the number of items to return. In
Example 7, we tell the LimitIterator to start at
index 2 (the third element) and limit the results to three items. This
iterator could be extended and combined with the
FilterIterator to provide a powerful mechanism
for iterating through database recordsets, limiting and filtering out
specific records, for example.
